My Contributions / What I Did for Day 1

As part of the Murf AI Voice Agent Challenge – Day 1, I set up this project end-to-end and got the voice agent running successfully.
Here’s what I completed:

Set up the backend with LiveKit and configured all required environment variables

Installed dependencies, created a virtual environment, and launched the agent runner

Started the frontend and connected it with the backend

Successfully interacted with the voice agent in my browser

Recorded a demo of the conversation as required for Day 1

Posted my progress on LinkedIn as part of the #MurfAIVoiceAgentsChallenge

This fork will continue to include updates as I progress through all 10 days of the challenge .
